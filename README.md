Part I: Perform Any 6 assignments
1
Design a distributed application using RPC for remote computation where client submits an
integer value to the server and server calculates factorial and returns the result to the client
program.
2 Design a distributed application using RMI for remote computation where client submits two
strings to the server and server returns the concatenation of the given strings.
3 Design a distributed application using MapReduce under Hadoop for: a) Character counting in
a given text file. b) Counting no. of occurrences of every word in a given text file.
4 Implement Union, Intersection, Complement and Difference operations on fuzzy sets. Also
create fuzzy relations by Cartesian product of any two fuzzy sets and perform max-min
composition on any two fuzzy relations.
5 Write code to simulate requests coming from clients and distribute them among the servers
using the load balancing algorithms.
6 Optimization of genetic algorithm parameter in hybrid genetic algorithm-neural network
modelling: Application to spray drying of coconut milk.
7 Implementation of Clonal selection algorithm using Python.
8 Create and Art with Neural style transfer on given image using deep learning.

Part II: (Perform Any 4 Assignments)
1 To apply the artificial immune pattern recognition to perform a task of structure damage
Classification.
2 Implement DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms) using Python.
3 Design and develop a distributed Hotel booking application using Java RMI. A distributed hotel
booking system consists of the hotel server and the client machines. The server manages hotel
rooms booking information. A customer can invoke the following operations at his machine i)
Book the room for the specific guest ii) Cancel the booking of a guest.
4 Design and develop a distributed application to find the coolest/hottest year from the available
weather data. Use weather data from the Internet and process it using MapReduce.
5 Implement Ant colony optimization by solving the Traveling salesman problem using python
Problem statement- A salesman needs to visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the original
city. The task is to find the shortest possible route that the salesman can take to visit all the cities
and return to the starting city.
6 Create and Art with Neural style transfer on given image using deep learning.
